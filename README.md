# The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)
Ideal simulations of small molecular Hamiltonians using VQE models with strategies to enhance their efficiency. The simulation codes include UCCSD-VQE and ADAPT-VQE models with strategies to investigate application of qubit operators and symmetry-preserving operator pools. \

The project comprises my master thesis that concludes a five-year integrated master's program in Applied Physics and Mathematics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.
